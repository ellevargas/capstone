# Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Problem Statement__: I would like to build an app that will provide a registry of Adies and staff, a job board, and a company roster to facilitate the communication processes currently in place. 

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
  - your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions)
  - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
  - differentiation: what makes your idea/product different
  
1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?
  - Target users:
  - Are digitally active, but range from digital native to late-adopter (the app should have a clean interface and be easy to use and streamlined)
  - Folks involved with Ada Developers Academy (the job board would be a good feature - students will be searching for work after graduating, and if Adies currently employed would like to put a heads-up out in order to get resumes then this would be a good place to put out feelers)
  - Range in age from 20s to 60s (the app should have a neutral color palate and should offer responsive design for viewing on a variety of devices from smartphone to desktop)
  - Identify as women, non-binary, and/or genderqueer (the app should have gender-neutral language and its tone must be inclusive and self-aware)
  - Staff work for a nonprofit and are managing heavy loads (the app should allow students to view past students' tech stacks for capstones, make initial contact with their mentors, and locate Adies who interned at companies they are curious about to take stress off of staff)

1. __Wireframes__:
  - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
